## ***Introduction***.

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a state-based, CDC-assisted health-data collection project and partnership of state health departments, CDC’s Division of Population Health, and other CDC 
programs and offices.
It comprises telephone surveys conducted by the health departments of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam.

This Summary Data Quality Report presents detailed descriptions of the 2018 BRFSS calling outcomes and call summary information for each of the states and territories that participated. All BRFSS public-use data are 
collected by landline telephone and cellular telephone to produce a single data set aggregated from the 2018
BRFSS territorial- and state-level data sets. The variables and outcomes provided in this document are 
applicable to a combined data set of responses from participants using landline telephones and cellular 
telephones within each of the states and territories.
The inclusion of data from cellular telephone interviews in the BRFSS public release data set has been standard 
protocol since 2011. In many respects, 2011 was a year of change—both in BRFSS’s approach and 
methodology. As the results of cellular telephone interviews were added in 2011, so were new weighting 
procedures that could accommodate the inclusion of new weighting variables. Data users should note that 
weighting procedures are likely to affect trend lines when comparing BRFSS data collected before and after 
2011. Because of these changes, users are advised NOT to make direct comparisons with pre-2011 data, and 
instead, should begin new trend lines with that year. Details of changes beginning with the 2011 BRFSS are 
provided in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), which highlights weighting and coverage 
effects on trend lines.
1 Since 2011, each yearly data set has included a larger percentage of calls from the cell 
phone sample. In 2018, a majority of the BRFSS interviews were conducted by cell phone. The annual 
codebooks provide information on the number and percentage of calls conducted by landline and cell phone by 
year. 
The measures presented in this document are designed to summarize the quality of the 2018 BRFSS survey 
data. Response rates, cooperation rates, and refusal rates for BRFSS are calculated using standards set by the 
American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR).
2 The BRFSS has calculated 2018 response rates 
using AAPOR Response Rate #4, which is in keeping with rates provided by BRFSS before 2011 using rates 
from the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO).

On the basis of the AAPOR guidelines, response rate calculations include assumptions of eligibility among 
potential respondents or households that are not interviewed. Changes in the geographic distribution of cellular 
telephone numbers by telephone companies and the portability of landline telephone numbers are likely to make 
it more difficult than in the past to determine which telephone numbers are out-of-sample and which telephone 
numbers represent likely households. The BRFSS calculates likely households and eligible persons using the 
proportions of eligible households/persons among all phone numbers where eligibility has been determined. 
This eligibility factor appears in calculations of response, cooperation, resolution, and refusal rates.

## ***Interpretation of BRFSS Response Rates***.

Because this report reflects the inclusion of BRFSS cellular telephone interviews, contextual information on 
cellular telephone response rates is provided below. Although cellular telephone response rates are generally 
lower than landline telephone response rates across most surveys, the BRFSS has achieved a cellular telephone 
response rate that compares favorably with other similar surveys (Table 1). Moreover, since the initial inclusion 
of cell phone respondents, the proportion of the sample that is interviewed by cell phone has increased. In many 
states, cell phone respondents are the majority of the sample. Since 2012, median BRFSS cell phone response 
rates have risen slightly. Overall, BRFSS response rates have leveled-off in the past few years, with landline 
rates declining and cell phone rates improving. In 2018, the screening of eligible landline phone numbers has 
improved, which may account for a slight improvement in the proportion of numbers identified as working 
phone numbers in the landline sample. This change would not necessarily increase response rates. The levelingoff of telephone survey response rates is noted for other federal surveys as well.4
